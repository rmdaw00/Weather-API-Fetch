# Weather-API-Fetch
Simple Javascript xhttp request that calls weather api. this was one of my first javascript web api related projects over a year ago, it was basic javascript, I was proud of the UI and the end result, super simple 1 html file, allows adding more cities, and allows refreshing, shows pictures, temperatures.
